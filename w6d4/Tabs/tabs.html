            Saluki Temperament
            The Saluki is an independent, athletic, and spirited breed with a keen hunting instinct. These sight hounds will spot things you don't and take off after them. They sometimes catch and kill their prey. They can run at 35 mph, so you will not catch a Saluki if he gets away, and they are notoriously bad at the recall. A Saluki needs a fenced area to run in, in order to be happy. Be aware that they can jump over a 5' fence, and they are also skilled diggers who can dig under a fence. The #1 cause of death for a Saluki is being hit by a vehicle. This breed loves to run more than anything else in the world. A daily leash walk is not enough for the Saluki, and asking him to adjust to this, what he would see as dormant, lifestyle really isn't fair to the dog. He loves to romp around enjoying vigorous exercise outside, but he will then want to come in and sleep on your bed, and he is particularly fond of pillows. He likes to lie on some soft pillows and take a long nap. The Saluki can be taught obedience but it will require patience and consistency from his master. Even a well-trained Saluki is not terribly obedient. Still, they excel at lure coursing, agility, flyball, jumping, racing, and tracking. They also make great therapy dogs. They obviously enjoy having a job to do. These are gentle animals who are loving, loyal, sensitive, and devoted to their humans. They are affectionate, but not as demonstrative as some breeds. They are intuitive and intelligent, and they like to make their own decisions. They can be mischievous and will become destructive if lonely. They don't like to be left alone for hours at a time. If they are lonely or stressed, they may howl and bay, but in general, the breed does not bark unnecessarily. They are excellent with children, especially if raised around them, but they are a little too dignified for fetch. They usually enjoy the company of other dogs. They can also do well with cats, especially if they grow up with them. They are usually aloof with strangers, but are peaceful with everyone. Except of course, the squirrels, rabbits, and birds.

            Samoyed Temperament
            The Samoyed is an affectionate people-dog who will want to be the center of attention. He will crave your attention and will either behave or misbehave to get it, whichever seems to work better at the time. This is an energetic, athletic, working dog who enjoys hiking, herding, weight pulling, sledding, conformation, and agility. A Samoyed needs a job to do. Early obedience training is important because if you don't establish yourself as the pack leader early on, your Samoyed will take on the role. This is an uncannily intelligent breed who thinks independently. They will learn your command quickly but they will also attach their own interpretation to it. It can be especially difficult to train this breed to walk on a lead, because these dogs were bred to pull. The Samoyed is an energetic breed that needs exercise every day. They do best with a fenced-in yard, as they will chase a cat or squirrel that they find interesting. And once they get away, it can be very hard to get them to come back. Be careful that your Samoyed does not dig his way under your fence to escape, because he will. They are very talented diggers and many of them enjoy "gardening" and will dig and rearrange your garden. Some also enjoy eating foreign objects. The "chewing" phase for a Samoyed can last for years. They can be quite mischievous and are famous for the sparkle in their eye and their ability to smile. These are expressive, vibrant dogs who like to stay busy and like to be involved. They are quick-witted and inquisitive and remain playful for their entire lives. They love to play with and be with children. They are gentle with and very protective of children. The Samoyed makes a very good watch dog. He enjoys watching everything and he will bark a warning if something new and exciting is happening outside, whether it's a squirrel or a burglar. However, once the burglar is through the door, your Samoyed will show him to the silverware. Samoyeds are very vocal and love to bark, yap, yodel, holler, and sing. They truly love the sound of their own voice, but are usually not problem barkers. However, it's really up to your neighbors to define problem barking. The Samoyed is incredibly perceptive of human emotion. Lack of harmony in the home might upset him. He cannot be happy if you are unhappy, and he is known for giving extra cuddles to someone who is sad. They have been known to be extra attentive and loving to family members a few days before those people fall ill. They also seem to know who truly loves them, who just tolerates them, and who dislikes them and will respond accordingly. This is a dog who needs to be with you all the time, everywhere. Lonely Samoyeds are known for chewing the hair off their legs and tails. They need to be with you to be healthy. They will want to ride in the car with you and sleep in the bed with you. They are trusting, loyal, gentle, and loving.

            Schipperke Temperament
            The Schipperke is alert, active, inquisitive, intelligent and hopelessly devoted to his master. They are a beloved playmate and a natural watchdog with a piercing bark. (They can be a touch yappy.) Schips seem to know that they are smart and cute, and if you let them, they will take over your household. These are extremely active dogs. They are confident and independent, and can be a bit willful. The Schipperke has excels at seemingly everything the dog world has to offer: obedience, agility, flyball, rally, heelwork to music, herding, tracking -- they've even been known to enjoy a game of patty cake. This is the breed that can do it all. Unless you ask him to sit around and do nothing. This he cannot handle and will begin strewing your trash and dirty laundry all over the house. Schips are rather famous for being devoted to children and are very protective of them. This doesn't always hold true though when dealing with an adult Schip who hasn't been around children much. This can be a dominant breed. The Schip has a good nose on him and if he finds a scent that interests him, he will follow it, regardless of where you want him to go. They have a tendency to explore once they've escaped. They like to be on the go and do best with a family who feels the same. Schips make excellent hiking, camping, and traveling companions. They do well with other dogs, as well as cats, horses and cows. They don't like to be left home without you, as they feel they have a right to be involved in whatever you are doing. They want to be where the action is. And beware if the action is in your flowerbed, as these are skilled diggers. They also don't seem to be in any hurry to housetrain. These are enthusiastic, joyful, highly energetic dogs who are fearless and devoted. They are vigilant and consider it their job to protect their family and property.
